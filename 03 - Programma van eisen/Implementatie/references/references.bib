abstract={Existing objective speech-intelligibility measures are suitable for several types of degradation, however, it turns out that they are less appropriate for methods where noisy speech is processed by a time-frequency (TF) weighting, e.g., noise reduction and speech separation. In this paper, we present an objective intelligibility measure, which shows high correlation (rho=0.95) with the intelligibility of both noisy, and TF-weighted noisy speech. The proposed method shows significantly better performance than three other, more sophisticated, objective measures. Furthermore, it is based on an intermediate intelligibility measure for short-time (approximately 400 ms) TF-regions, and uses a simple DFT-based TF-decomposition. In addition, a free Matlab implementation is provided.},

abstract={Previous objective speech quality assessment models, such as bark spectral distortion (BSD), the perceptual speech quality measure (PSQM), and measuring normalizing blocks (MNB), have been found to be suitable for assessing only a limited range of distortions. A new model has therefore been developed for use across a wider range of network conditions, including analogue connections, codecs, packet loss and variable delay. Known as perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), it is the result of integration of the perceptual analysis measurement system (PAMS) and PSQM99, an enhanced version of PSQM. PESQ is expected to become a new ITU-T recommendation P.862, replacing P.861 which specified PSQM and MNB},

volume={9}, 
number={3}, 
pages={1120-1127}, 
abstract={In this paper, we propose a fingerprint-based localization scheme that exploits the location dependency of the channel impulse response (CIR). We approximate the CIR by applying inverse Fourier transform to the receiver's channel estimation. The amplitudes of the approximated CIR (ACIR) vector are further transformed into the logarithmic scale to ensure that elements in the ACIR vector contribute fairly to the location estimation, which is accomplished through nonparametric kernel regression. As shown in our simulations, when both the number of access points and density of training locations are the same, our proposed scheme displays significant advantages in localization accuracy, compared to other fingerprint-based methods found in the literature. Moreover, absolute localization accuracy of the proposed scheme is shown to be resilient to the real time environmental changes caused by human bodies with random positions and orientations.},

abstract={Microphone arrays have been used in various applications to capture conversations, such as in meetings and teleconferences. In many cases, the microphone and likely source locations are known a priori, and calculating beamforming filters is therefore straightforward. In ad-hoc situations, however, when the microphones have not been systematically positioned, this information is not available and beamforming must be achieved blindly. In achieving this, a commonly neglected issue is whether it is optimal to use all of the available microphones, or only an advantageous subset of these. This paper commences by reviewing different approaches to blind beamforming, characterizing them by the way they estimate the signal propagation vector and the spatial coherence of noise in the absence of prior knowledge of microphone and speaker locations. Following this, a novel clustered approach to blind beamforming is motivated and developed. Without using any prior geometrical information, microphones are first grouped into localized clusters, which are then ranked according to their relative distance from a speaker. Beamforming is then performed using either the closest microphone cluster, or a weighted combination of clusters. The clustered algorithms are compared to the full set of microphones in experiments on a database recorded on different ad-hoc array geometries. These experiments evaluate the methods in terms of signal enhancement as well as performance on a large vocabulary speech recognition task.},

abstract = "Multi-level periodic perturbation signals for system identification in the frequency domain are defined. The design and properties of these signals, and the output signal processing methods used with them to reduce or eliminate the effects of noise and nonlinearity, are developed. Both pseudo-random and multi-frequency perturbation signals are considered, and an application in which these signals were used to identify the dynamics of steel strip in an industrial process is described. It is concluded that the use of these signals leads to considerable benefits, and that they are to be preferred for identification schemes of this kind. "
