First and foremost, our gratitude goes out to our supervisor dr. Jorge Mart\'inez Casta\~neda for his excellent guidance and valuable insights throughout the entirety of this project. Without his help, we would not have been able to make such progress in a short amount of time. In addition we would like to thank prof. Bastiaan Kleijn for sharing his valuable knowledge, which helped us shape the project in an early stage. Also the interest from Jan Skoglund (Google Inc.) gave us the inspiration to put time and effort in this project to make it a success. We thank Henry den Bok for helping us to set up the measurements in the anechoic chamber at the TU Delft. Finally we want to thank Tim, Rosalie, Sjoerd and Roy for the good collaboration during this Electrical Engineering Bachelor Graduation Project.
