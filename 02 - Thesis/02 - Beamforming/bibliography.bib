abstract={Existing objective speech-intelligibility measures are suitable for several types of degradation, however, it turns out that they are less appropriate for methods where noisy speech is processed by a time-frequency (TF) weighting, e.g., noise reduction and speech separation. In this paper, we present an objective intelligibility measure, which shows high correlation (rho=0.95) with the intelligibility of both noisy, and TF-weighted noisy speech. The proposed method shows significantly better performance than three other, more sophisticated, objective measures. Furthermore, it is based on an intermediate intelligibility measure for short-time (approximately 400 ms) TF-regions, and uses a simple DFT-based TF-decomposition. In addition, a free Matlab implementation is provided.},

abstract={Previous objective speech quality assessment models, such as bark spectral distortion (BSD), the perceptual speech quality measure (PSQM), and measuring normalizing blocks (MNB), have been found to be suitable for assessing only a limited range of distortions. A new model has therefore been developed for use across a wider range of network conditions, including analogue connections, codecs, packet loss and variable delay. Known as perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), it is the result of integration of the perceptual analysis measurement system (PAMS) and PSQM99, an enhanced version of PSQM. PESQ is expected to become a new ITU-T recommendation P.862, replacing P.861 which specified PSQM and MNB},

title={Clustered Blind Beamforming From Ad-Hoc Microphone Arrays}, 
year={2011}, 
month={May}, 
volume={19},

pages={661-676}, 
abstract={Microphone arrays have been used in various applications to capture conversations, such as in meetings and teleconferences. In many cases, the microphone and likely source locations are known a priori, and calculating beamforming filters is therefore straightforward. In ad-hoc situations, however, when the microphones have not been systematically positioned, this information is not available and beamforming must be achieved blindly. In achieving this, a commonly neglected issue is whether it is optimal to use all of the available microphones, or only an advantageous subset of these. This paper commences by reviewing different approaches to blind beamforming, characterizing them by the way they estimate the signal propagation vector and the spatial coherence of noise in the absence of prior knowledge of microphone and speaker locations. Following this, a novel clustered approach to blind beamforming is motivated and developed. Without using any prior geometrical information, microphones are first grouped into localized clusters, which are then ranked according to their relative distance from a speaker. Beamforming is then performed using either the closest microphone cluster, or a weighted combination of clusters. The clustered algorithms are compared to the full set of microphones in experiments on a database recorded on different ad-hoc array geometries. These experiments evaluate the methods in terms of signal enhancement as well as performance on a large vocabulary speech recognition task.},

year={1996},

pages={67-94}, 
abstract={The quintessential goal of sensor array signal processing is the estimation of parameters by fusing temporal and spatial information, captured via sampling a wavefield with a set of judiciously placed antenna sensors. The wavefield is assumed to be generated by a finite number of emitters, and contains information about signal parameters characterizing the emitters. A review of the area of array processing is given. The focus is on parameter estimation methods, and many relevant problems are only briefly mentioned. We emphasize the relatively more recent subspace-based methods in relation to beamforming. The article consists of background material and of the basic problem formulation. Then we introduce spectral-based algorithmic solutions to the signal parameter estimation problem. We contrast these suboptimal solutions to parametric methods. Techniques derived from maximum likelihood principles as well as geometric arguments are covered. Later, a number of more specialized research topics are briefly reviewed. Then, we look at a number of real-world problems for which sensor array processing methods have been applied. We also include an example with real experimental data involving closely spaced emitters and highly correlated signals, as well as a manufacturing application example},

pages={1120-1127}, 
abstract={In this paper, we propose a fingerprint-based localization scheme that exploits the location dependency of the channel impulse response (CIR). We approximate the CIR by applying inverse Fourier transform to the receiver's channel estimation. The amplitudes of the approximated CIR (ACIR) vector are further transformed into the logarithmic scale to ensure that elements in the ACIR vector contribute fairly to the location estimation, which is accomplished through nonparametric kernel regression. As shown in our simulations, when both the number of access points and density of training locations are the same, our proposed scheme displays significant advantages in localization accuracy, compared to other fingerprint-based methods found in the literature. Moreover, absolute localization accuracy of the proposed scheme is shown to be resilient to the real time environmental changes caused by human bodies with random positions and orientations.},

abstract={Adaptive beamforming algorithms can be extremely sensitive to slight errors in array characteristics. Errors which are uncorrelated from sensor to sensor pass through the beamformer like uncorrelated or spatially white noise. Hence, gain against white noise is a measure of robustness. A new algorithm is presented which includes a quadratic inequality constraint on the array gain against uncorrelated noise, while minimizing output power subject to multiple linear equality constraints. It is shown that a simple scaling of the projection of tentative weights, in the subspace orthogonal to the linear constraints, can be used to satisfy the quadratic inequality constraint. Moreover, this scaling is equivalent to a projection onto the quadratic constraint boundary so that the usual favorable properties of projection algorithms apply. This leads to a simple, effective, robust adaptive beamforming algorithm in which all constraints are satisfied exactly at each step and roundoff errors do not accumulate. The algorithm is then extended to the case of a more general quadratic constraint.},

abstract = "This paper discusses two novel non-iterative design procedures based on eigenfilters for designing broadband beamformers with an arbitrary spatial directivity pattern for an arbitrary microphone configuration. In the conventional eigenfilter technique a reference frequency-angle point is required, whereas in the eigenfilter technique based on a \{TLS\} (total least squares) error criterion, no reference point is required. It is shown how to design broadband beamformers in the far-field, near-field and mixed near-field far-field of the microphone array. Both eigenfilter techniques are compared with other broadband beamformer design procedures (least-squares, maximum energy array, non-linear criterion). It will be shown by simulations that among the considered non-iterative design procedures the \{TLS\} eigenfilter technique has the best performance, i.e. best resembling the performance of the non-linear design procedure but having a significantly lower computational complexity.

abstract={A sensitivity analysis of two distortionless beamformers is presented in this paper. Specifically, two well-known variants, namely the minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformers, are considered. In our scenario, which is typical to many modern communications systems, waves emitted by multiple point sources are received by an antenna array. An analytical expression for the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) improvement obtained by both beamformers under steering errors is derived. These expression are experimentally evaluated and compared with the robust Capon beamformer (RCB), a robust variant of the MPDR beamformer. We show that the MVDR beamformer, which uses the noise correlation matrix in its minimization criterion, is more robust to steering errors than its counterparts, that use the received signal correlation matrix. Furthermore, even if the noise correlation matrix is erroneously estimated due to steering errors in the interference direction, the MVDR advantage is still maintained for reasonable range of steering errors. These conclusions conform with Cox findings. Only line of sight propagation regime is considered in the current contribution. Ongoing research extends this work to fading channels.},
