For the completion of this project we would like to thank dr. Jorge Mart\`inez-Casta\~neda, our supervisor, without whom we never would have completed this project with these results.
In addition, we would like to thank professor Bastiaan Kleijn, who helped us in the absence of Jorge and gave us some good insights, and dr. Ioan Lager for organizing this years Bachelor graduation project.

We have spend almost two weeks in the anechoic room at the Applied Physics department of the Delft University of Technology to conduct our measurement.
Therefore we would like to thank Henry den Bok, for preparing our measurement set-up, his great tips and always being prepared to help us with little things like connectors which were not at our disposal.

In addition to finishing this thesis, to finish our Bachelor graduation project there were two more parts that had to be completed: the business plan, with special thanks to professor Koen Bertels, and the Ethics course taught by dr. Otto Kroesen.

At last, but not least, we would like to thank our fellow students, with whom we have started and finished this project in a great collaboration: Erik Wouters, Niels van Wijngaarden, Roy Smeding and Sjoerd Bosma.
