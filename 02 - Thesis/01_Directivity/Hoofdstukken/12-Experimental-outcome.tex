In this chapter, the final results will be presented first (a few results can be found on page \pageref{fig:res_NX506_pluis} to \pageref{fig:res_NX501_pluis}).
Thereafter the results are discussed: are there notable results, which do or do not match with the expectations (Section \ref{sec:ms-expectations}).
A little conclusion will be provided at the end of this chapter.

\section*{Experimental outcome - Conclusion}
In this chapter the outcome of the measurements is presented (page \pageref{fig:res_NX506_pluis} to \pageref{fig:res_NX501_pluis}) and discussed.
In the discussion different questions are addressed: what are noticeable similarities or differences with the expectations, how does the addition of the surface influence the directivity and what is the difference of the behaviour of two phones of the same type?
For the answers of the main questions of this thesis, the reader is referred to Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion}.
