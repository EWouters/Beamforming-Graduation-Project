\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Succesful completion of this project would never have been possible without the excellent guidance of our supervisor, dr. Jorge Mart\'inez Casta\~neda. We would like to thank him for his support, advice and guidance.
Furthermore, professor Bastiaan Kleijn of the Delft University of Technology has been very helpful with his insights. Henry den Bok at the Faculty of Applied Sciences was very helpful in preparing measurement setups and dr. Jan Skoglund at Google inspired us to get the most out of this project. Professor Koen Bertels was of great help in compiling our accompanying business plan. It was a pleasure working together with our fellow students Erik, Niels, Rosalie and Tim on the encompassing system.

Finally, we would like to thank dr. Ioan Lager for organizing the Bachelor graduation project this year.
