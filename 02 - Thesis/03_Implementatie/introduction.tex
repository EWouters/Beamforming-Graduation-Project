\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

In many larger businesses, conference calls are used to communicate between different teams, or with other teams in different locations. The systems for these conference calls are generally complicated to configure, and once configured it can still be difficult to make every participant heard.
One potential solution is to use a network of smartphones, which most conference call participants already possess. Each smartphone has at least one microphone, meaning a network of these microphones can be processed as a microphone array. As a result, expensive conferencing hardware can be replaced by a network of smartphones running an application.
This smartphone microphone array could also be used for other applications, such as speaker identification and improving the accuracy of speech recognition systems.

In general, the applications presented above rely on spatial filtering of acoustic data. In other words, they strive to enhance speech by taking into account the locations of the microphones and sources. This technique is commonly known as beamforming \cite{VanVeen19884}. In these examples, the smartphones can be seen as ad-hoc arrays of wireless acoustic sensors \cite{Gaubitch2014}. Further enhancement of audio may be accomplished by incorporating microphone directivities into the beamforming algorithms \cite{thomas2012, ba2007}. Beamforming with ad-hoc microphone arrays requires known locations of microphones \cite{himawan2011} and synchronization of sensor data \cite{Parviainen2014, golan2012}. Using directivities further requires the orientation of the smartphones to be known \cite{Gaubitch2014}.

Acoustic self-localization of smartphones is possible, though with limited accuracy \cite{Parviainen2014, hennecke2011}. Using external loudspeakers, sub-$5~\mathrm{cm}$ variances of positioning algorithms have been realized on a variety of wireless sensors \cite{raykar2005}.
Synchronization of the microphone data can be achieved using correlation processing for both time offset \cite{Knapp1976, wehr2004} and sampling rate offset \cite{golan2012, cherkassky2014} correction. 
Orientation estimates may be directly obtained from Android smartphones, but its accuracy is severely limited \cite{goslinski2015}.

Solutions to each individual challenge stated above are described in the literature, but no working beamforming system including directivities using smartphone microphones is known to the authors. This work, in conjunction with the work of Van Wijngaarden and Wouters \cite{BAP:ErikNiels} and Brinkman and De Rooij \cite{BAP:RosalieTim}, strives to form the basis of such a system. 

The rest of this document is structured as follows: the current chapter further specifies the exact problem addressed in this work, followed by a list of requirements on the resulting system. Chapter \ref{ch:synchronization} details the challenges faced in synchronizing the audio signals, along with solutions for these challenges and evaluation of these solutions.
Chapter \ref{ch:system} details the data acquisition system that was built, and gives quantitative performance results for orientation measurement in the context of the target application.
Chapter \ref{ch:test} describes experiments done on the resulting subsystem. Finally, the document is concluded by a discussion of the achieved performance, as well as recommendations for future work, in chapter \ref{ch:conclusion}.

\section{Problem formulation}

The aim of the complete system is to perform beamforming on smartphone microphone signals. A diagram of an example usage scenario is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:goal_example}. A number of smartphones are located on a table in a normal office environment. Located around the table are a number of desired audio sources (e.g. people speaking) and noise sources (e.g. background conversation or traffic outside). The position of all sources and microphones is assumed known.
By combining these recordings, taking into account the location information, an output audio signal is produced that ideally has better perceived quality than the individual microphone signals.
This work specifically focuses on the overall signal acquisition and audio synchronization aspects of the system. Application of the actual beamforming algorithms is left to Van Wijngaarden and Wouters \cite{BAP:ErikNiels} who also incorporate work done on microphone directivity measurements by Brinkman and De Rooij \cite{BAP:RosalieTim} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:global_overview}).

\subsection{Scope}
This work describes a complete system for sensor data acquisition, taking the form of an Android smartphone application and a \matlab and Java processing server. An overview of the components of this system is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:local_overview}. The choices for these platforms will be outlined in sections \ref{sec:android} and \ref{sec:matlab} respectively.

This work will also look at the state of the art of both orientation estimation and localization and make some recommendations for future work. It was chosen not to incorporate this functionality in the application, but instead assume the smartphone orientations and positions are known.

The following section details the definitions and mathematical symbols used in the rest of this work. A set of requirements for this subsystem follows in section \ref{sec:requirements}.
