function mpos = regmicsperim2(fom,sp,num, stp)
%  This function generates the microphone coordinates for an 
%  array placement over a perimeter of a rectangle
%
%      mpos = regmicsperim2(fom, sp, num, stp)
% 
%  The inputs are::
%  FOM =>  the field over which the mics are place defined by the lower left and upper right
%          verticies of the rectangular plane or room. FOM is a 2 column matrix, where each column
%          indicates the opposite corners or the rectangle for the
%          microphone positions.  If vector in FOM are 2-D they will be
%          padded with zeros to make them 3-D.
%  SP =>   uniform spacing between mics
%  NUM =>  the number of mics.
%  STP = > optional parameter indicating the first mic position along the perimeter.
%
%  Mics will be place in a clockwise direction (looking down on the field  of view) from the initial
%  point, which is either STP if given, the first point in FOM. The subsequent mics are placed with
%  a constant SP spacing along the perimeter in the clockwise direction.  If a mic does not fall evenly
%  on a corner, the distance between the mic on the next edge is taken directly (not along the rectangular
%  perimeter). If the number and mic spacing result in a length greater than the
%  perimeter, it will wrap around.
%
%  The output will be columnwise coordinates of the microphones in matrix MPOS
%  The dimensionality of the output coordinates in MPOS will be the same as
%  those in FOM.
