%  This script reads in an audio file segment of a phrase about a scare crow
%  and uses the simarraysigim function to simulate this word spoken over an
%  array in a room with reverberation.  It compares the recordings between
%  a near and far mic to compare the impact of the room response (the
%  further the mic from the speaker the more room effects can be heard).
%  This script requires the programs "simarraysigim.m," "regmicsline.m,"
%  "roomimpres.m," and wave file scare_crow.wav
