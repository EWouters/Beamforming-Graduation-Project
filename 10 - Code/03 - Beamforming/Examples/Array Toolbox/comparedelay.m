%  This script demonstrates the delay estimators using a time domain approach 
%  (function DELAYESTTM), and a frequency domain approach (function
%  DELAYSETFR).  The signal and simulation parameters can be set by editing the
%  initial lines of this script (see comments for details).  The signal
%  processing options for the delay estimator can also be set (see help on
%  the DELAYESTTM and DELAYESTFR functions) .  Signal simulation values include
%  the delay, SNR, sampling frequency, and bandlimits for the test signals. It performs
%  a Monte Carlo simulation of the signal in noise, where the noise pattern and
%  signal relationship to the window is varied in each run.  The figure for the
%  signal in noise are presented in each pass of the loop along with the estimation
%  errors for both approaches presented in the titles of the figure.
%  The program pauses with each plot.  These line can be commented out for
%  larger Monte Carlo runs

%  Center clipping is good for removing low-level noise distribute over the
%  windowed segment
prot.cliptype = 'none';  %  Select clipping type

%  Detrending is important for removing DC and low frequency artifacts that
%  may dominate a correlation peak
prot.detrendord = 1;  %  Select type of detrending, this detrending removes the best line fit
%  Time domain method interpolates to locate a peak on a higher resolution 
%  grid spacing allowed for by the original sampling rate
prot.interpord = 4;  %  Half the Sinc function interpolation order
prot.interpfac = 10; %  Number of interpolated points between samples (factor to decrease grid spacing)

%  where the signal energy is known to be high
