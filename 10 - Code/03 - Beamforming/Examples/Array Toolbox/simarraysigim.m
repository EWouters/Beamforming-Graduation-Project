function [sigout, tax] = simarraysigim(sigarray, fs, sigpos, mpos, forv, bs, prop)
% This function simulates stationary sounds received over an array of microphones in a
% rectangular room. Segments of multiple sound souces are contained in columns of
% SIGARRAY. Each source sound is assigned a position in space (corresponding to
% columns of SIGPOS), projected into the room (omnidirectional), and received over
% a microphone array. All distances and times provided in vectors MPOS, SIGPOS, FORV,
% and speed and attenuation parameters prop.c and prop.airatten must be in METERS, Hz,
% and SECONDS. Each microphone corresponds to a column in the output matrix SIGOUT.
% Multipath is computed using the image method for a rectangular room. The parameters
% associated with the multipath room properties are in matrix FORV and vector BS, in
% addition to optional parameters DBD, and SFAC.  The second output argument is the
% corresponding time axis TAX, where 0 corresponds to the first time sample in sigarray
% starting from its source postion.
% 
%  [sigout, tax] = simarraysigim(sigarray, fs, sigpos, mpos, forv, bs, prop)
%
% The input arguments are:
% sigarray => Matrix where each column represents a source signal and each row represents a time
%             sample of that signal.  All segments must be the same length and should be trimmed
%             to just the sound of interest.  Signals can be padded with zeros to make them all
%             the same length
% fs =>       Sampling frequency of input and output audio signals
% sigpos =>   3 row matrix where each column represents the x,y, and z coordinates of a
%             signal source.
% mpos =>     3 row matrix where each column represents the coordinates
%             of the mic and each row is the dimension x,y, and z.
% forv =>     2 column vector containing vertex indices of opposite corners
%             of rectangular room.
% bs   =>     6 element vector containing the reflection coefficients of the
%             walls, ceiling, and floor.  The first 4 elements correspond to
%             the walls starting at the vertex given in column 1 of FORV
%             and going in a clockwise looking down on the room. BS(5) is the
%             floor and BS(6) is the ceiling reflection coefficient.
% prop =>     A data structure with various fields related to the
%             propagation of sound.
%             The required fields are the speed of sound:
%             "c"        speed of sound in meters/second (FYI, c =
%                        331.4+0.6*Temperature in Centigrade)  This value
%                        can be computed from temperature, pressure, and
%                        humidity using function SpeedOfSound.m
%             and the decible limit at which point to stop simulating
%             wall reflections:
%             "dbd"     Decibles down from first room reflection at which
%             to stop simulating subsequet reflections.  60 is a typical
%             number.  If this is too high the simulation will take a long
%             time as it accounts for more attenuating reflections.
%             If field "airatten" is present, it is taken as the frequency dependent
%             scale factor in units of dB per meter-Hz. A typical value is -3.2808399e-5.
%             If set to 0 no attenuation due to the air path is applied (the value must
%             be either 0 or negative). They will be applied directly to the propagating wave.
%                  If the "airatten" field is NOT present and instead "freq"
%             and "atten" are included where "prop.freq" is a vector of 
%             frequency points with "prop.atten" the corresponding
%             attenuation points in dB, the these will be used to implement
%             the frequency dependent attenuation.  See atmAtten.m for
%             generating these points based on temperature pressure and humidity.
%  Output parameters:
%   sigout => matrix with each column corresponding to the signal recieved at each
%             microphone defined in MPOS.
%   tax =>    (optional output)  time axis associated with the rows of
%             SIGOUT
