function[source]=tdoafunction(delaymat,c,fov)
%This function inputs the matrix 'delaymat',speed of sound 'c' and field of
%view 'fov' and outputs the estimated source location using the TDOA method.

%The input matrix 'delaymat' will have the microphone pairs and their corresponding delays
%arranged along each row.The number of rows correspond to the number of tdoa estimates.
% The first column corresponds to the time delays between the paired off mics, the next with 
%the reference microphones positions followed by the non-reference mic positions of the pair.
%The size of the 'delaymat' will be given by n x (2m+1) where n is the
%number of time delay estimates and m is the dimension of the microphones.
%The fov gives the corner points of the field of view around which the microphones are placed.
%The output will be the coordinates of the estimated sound source location.
