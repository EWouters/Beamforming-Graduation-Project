function sigout = cocktailp(sigin, spos, mpos, recinfo)
% This function simulates placing sound sources at specified positions in
% a room and recording the resulting sound field with spatially distributed
% microphones.  The function syntax is given by:
%
%      sigout = cocktailp(sigin, spos, mpos, recinfo)
%
% The inputs are:
%    sigin  =>  Matrix of sampled sound source files.  Each column
%               represents a different source
%    spos    => Matrix with same number of columns as "sigin" corresponding to 
%               the position of each source. Rows are the X,Y, and Z coordinates.
%    mpos    => Matrix describing the position of the microphones.  Each column
%               corresponds to the X,Y, and Z coordinate of a microphone.
%    recinfo => Data structure with recording environment parameters.  The fields are:
%               "fs"       sampling frequency used to resample the wave file to create "sigin"
%               "corners"  (Optional) a 2 column matrix denoting the coordinates of a
%                          pair of opposite corners of the rectangular room in which
%                          the recording was made.  If not present room reverberation
%                          will NOT be simulated.
%               "reflecc"  (optional) a 6 element vector denoting the reflection
%                          coefficients (between 0 and 1) of each of the room surfaces.
%                          The first 4 elements correspond to the walls going clockwise
%                          around the vertex given in the first column of "corners" (looking
%                          down from the ceiling), the next element is the ceiling and the
%                          last element is the floor.  If "corners" is not given these
%                          parameters will not be used.  The default values are .8 for 
%                          all walls and .6 for the floor and ceiling.
%                "dbd"    (optional) If reberation is simulatef, for multiple reflection this is the
%                          dB down value of wall reflection power from the first reflection
%                          for which is simulation no longer generates the reflection.  
%                          Default value is 60. 
%                "temp"    (optional) Temperature in Centigrade, default 22
%               "press"    (optional) Ambient air pressure in mmHg, default 29.92
%                 "hum"    (optional) Realative Humidity percent, default 38
%                "freq"    (optional) Frequencies at which to compute air
%                          attenuation function, default (fs/2)*[0:200]/200;
