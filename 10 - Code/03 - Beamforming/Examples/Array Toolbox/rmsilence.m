function [outsig,less,act_indexo] =  rmsilence(sig,fs,threshin)
% This function removes the silence intervals from the input speech based
% on an envelope threshold. The input signal is up-sampled, segmented to
% remove samples that fall below a threshold, and then re-sampled back to
% the original sampling rate, and filtered to smooth out the discontinuities
% where pauses in active speech occured.
% The threshold used is a scaled function of the median of the envlope.
% The default threshold is one-fourth of the median of the envelope.

% [outsig,less,act_index] =  rmsilence(sig,fs,threshin)
%  
% INPUTS
% sig-   Vectorized Speech signal input.  If sig has multiple columns
%        the first signal is considered the reference signal in which
%        the pause segments are detected and these are applied to
%        all other columns in the the matrix.
% fs -   Signal sampling frequency in Hertz
% threshin -  (OPTIONAL) Scale on threshold applied to the envelope for
%              detecting scilence periods.  The actual threshold is 
%              is computed by multiplying 'threshin" by the median
%              value of the envelope samples. The default is (.25), which
%              is 25% of the median envelope value over input 'sig'.
% OUTPUTS
% outsig -   Vectorized Signal Output with silence intervals corresponding to
%            the reference signals removed
% less -     Length of the silenced signal segement removed from the original
%            signal in seconds
% act_index - indices of original signal corresponding to active speech
