function [sd, tn] = delaytab(s,tab,fs,d,ns)
%  This function delays the signal in vector S sampled at FS by an amount
%  D denoted in seconds.  If NS is present in the input argument,
%  the output signal length will be equal to this value in seconds (either by
%  truncating or zero padding).   If not present, the output signal length
%  will vary depending on the delay (it will be the original
%  signal length plus the max delay rounded up to the next sample).
%
%    [sd, tn] = delaytab(s,tab,fs,d,ns)
%
%  The delayed version of the signal SD starts at the same time point (D should
%  not be negative otherwise an error will occur).  This version performs
%  the delay in the time domain with FIR shift (interpolation) filters, where the filter
%  coefficients for shifting to subsample resolution points are in rows of TAB.  IF
%  N intervals between sample points are desired then TAB should have N+1 rows
%  corresponding to all points including and between 2 consecutive sample points.  The
%  number of columns in TAB should be even, if odd an error will occur.  The actual
%  delay is then rounded to the nearest of these points. The filter only shifts
%  the signal a fraction of a sample point up to one complete sample at most.  The
%  integer delay is handeled by a vector offset assignment.  The FIR handles the fractional
%  part. IF TN is present in the output, a time axis is created for the output array where
%  0 denotes the original starting point for S.
%  If S is a matrix, the program will assume each column is a signal and
%  the number of elements in D must be equal to the number of columns.
%
%  The TAB matrix can be computed using the function  "subsamplefir"
