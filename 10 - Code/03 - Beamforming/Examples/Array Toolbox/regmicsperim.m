function mpos = regmicsperim(fom,sp,stp)
%  This function generates the microphone coordinates for an 
%  array placement over a perimeter of a rectangle
%
%      mpos = regmicsline(fom, sp, stp)
% 
%  The inputs are the field over which the mics are placed, FOM, and the
%  spacing between mics, SP.  FOM is a 2 column matrix, where each column
%  indicates the opposite corners of the rectangle for the microphone
%  positions.
%  The first mic will be placed at the first point in FOM. The subsequent mics
%  are placed with a constant SP spacing along the perimeter.  If the optional
%  parameter STP is given the first point will be displaced by a distance of SP
%  from the first vertex point toward the next vertex in the clockwise direction.
%  If a mic does not fall evenly on a corner, the distance between the mic on
%  the next edge is taken directly (not along the perimeter) to maintain mutual
%  mic distances. The last mic will be placed to maintain the distance with the prevous
%  mic; however, if it is less than SP to the original starting mic it will
%  be trimmed off.
%  The output will be columnwise coordinates of the microphones in matrix
%  MPOS.  If dimensions of vectors are only 2-D, they will be padded with
%  zeros to make them 3-D.  MPOS will always have 3 dimensions.
