function mleim = srpframenn(sigar, gridax, mpos, fs, c, srchwin)
% This function processes signals from a microphone array and
% creates an acoustic image according to a Steered Response
% Coherent Power (SRCP) algorithm for sound source location.
% The mic positions and field of view (FOV) grid points can
% be in any units as long as they are consistent with parameters
% listed below (I like meters and seconds).  A delay and sum
% beamformer is applied for each pixel in the FOV and the coherent
% power is computed for the sound eminating from the pixel location.
% Coherent power differs from regular power (squared sum normalized
% by time) in that only the power from signal cross correlation
% between 2 different mics is used in the summation.  So coherent
% power can be negative.  Large positive values indicate a strong
% correlation or coincidence between mic signals.  A large negative
% value represents a strong 180 degrees out of phase coincidence (very
% rare that this number can get large for more than 2 mics). 
% The output is the coherent power at each pixel and represents a
% liklihood of the sound source as a function of the spatial grid.  The
% number of axes in cell array GRIDAX determines the dimension of the
% ouput liklihood grid.  This particular version uses only integer delays
% for the delay and sum beamformer.
%
%   mleim = srpframenn(sigar, gridax, mpos, fs, c, srchwin)
%
% Inputs
%  "sigar"        Matrix where each column is the audio signal segment from
%                 each microphone.
%
%  "gridax"       Cell array of grid points for x-axis, y-axis and z-axis.
%                 The number of elements in this cell array can be less than
%                 3.  If so, it will do a reduce dimension output space.
%
%  "mpos"         Matrix indicating the x,y, and z cartesion positions of each
%                 mic, where the first row contains the x positions, second y
%                 positions, and third z positions.  If an axis is missing,
%                 only the x-y plane will be used.  The Dimensions should be
%                 consisent with the axes in cell array "gridax" and number of
%                 mics must be the same as columns in "sigar."
%           
%  "fs"           Sampling frequency of the audio mic signals in "sigar"
%
%  "c"            scalar is the speed of sound in the room.
%
%  "srchwin"      The window length over which coherent power is computed
%                 and represents the time resolution of acoustic image.
%                 Typically, the signals in "sigar" are longer than "searchwin"
%                 so that as delays are made to each signal, actual data will be
%                 shifted into the window over which the delay and sum operation
%                 is performed.
%                 In this implementation the signal from the furthest mic is not
%                 delayed. All other signals are delayed to sync up with the
%                 max delayed signal.
%                 If "sigar" is not long enough to have samples to
%                 shift into the correlation window, zero padding will
%                 occur.
%
%    This function requires the functions: ARWEIGHTS and DELAYINT from the array
%    toolbox to run.
