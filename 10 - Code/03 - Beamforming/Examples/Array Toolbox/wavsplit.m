function wavsplit(wavName, N, seglen, wininc)
%
%   This function opens a wavefile and splits it into N partitioned files  
%   with a partial overlap between contiguous partitions for use as an input
%   to another function that would typically apply a sliding window over the 
%   original file(such as a convolution operation). The last partition 
%   may trim the orignal file so that computations end with a full window.
%   
%      wavsplit(wavName, N, seglen, wininc)
%
%   Inputs:
%       1) wavName - string identifying wave file for partitioning
%       2) N - number of files to split the original into (positive integer)
%       3) seglen - Processing Window length for sliding window in terms of
%                   samples (positive integer)
%       4) wininc - Number of samples to increment sliding window(positive integer)
%
%   Outputs:
%       No Return values - creates N wavfiles into a dynamically created
%           directory "out_[wavName]", with each file named
%           part(integer).wav
%       The beginning and the ending indices of where the wav file is split
%           can be outputted to the screen by setting outputEn to 1 (line 86)
