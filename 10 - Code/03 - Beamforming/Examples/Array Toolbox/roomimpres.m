function [impres, t] = roomimpres(dlays, scls, c, fs, sfac)
%  This function computes the impulse response of a source-microphone pair in a room
%  modeled by a direct path and a sequence of image/multipath scatterers described by
%  delay times in vector DLAYS and corresponding attenuation factors in vector SCLS.
%  In addition, the generated impulse response accounts for the frequency
%  dependent attenuation in the air, based on vectors in data structure
%  SFAC.
%
%     [impres, t] = roomimpres(dlays, scls, c, fs, sfac)
%
%  The following parameters must be supplied at the input:
%  DLAYS  => Vector with sequence of delays in seconds representing multipath
%            interference
%  SCLS   => Vector with scale factors (reflection coefficients) correspoding to signals
%                    delayed by each element in DLAYS
%  C      => the speed of sound in meters per second
%  FS     => the sampling frequency for the impulse response
%  SFAC   => (optional) data structure with the frequency dependent attenuation
%                     vectors:
%                     sfac.freq = vector of frequencies where attenuation values are provided
%                     sfac.atten = vector of corresponding attenuation values in dB per meter (must be positive)
%                      see function atmAtten() for generating these points
%                      based on environmental conditions.
%                      The default value is set according the the ISO 9613-1 for temperature = 22 C, pressure
%                      29.92 inHg, Relative Humidity 38%.
%                      
% The outputs are:
% IMPRES => Vector containing the impulse response
% T      => optional parameter, a vector of time axis points corresponding
%           to the impuse response IMPRES
