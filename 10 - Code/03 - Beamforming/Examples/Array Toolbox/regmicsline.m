function mpos = regmicsline(fom,sp)
%  This function generates the microphone coordinates for regular
%  line array placement over a line, plane, or cube.
%
%      mpos = regmicsline(fom, sp)
% 
%  The inputs are the field over which the mics are placed, FOM, and the
%  spacing between mics, SP.  FOM is a 2 column matrix, where each column
%  indicates the begining and ending point of the microphones line array.
%  The first mic will be placed at the first point in FOM. The subsequent
%  mics are placed with a constant SP spacing along the line
%  connecting the 2 points in FOM.  The last mic will be placed at the
%  furthest point from the beginning that is less than or equal to the
%  distance to the last point in FOM.
%  The output will be columnwise coordinates of the microphones in matrix MPOS
%  The dimensionality of the output coordinates in MPOS will be the same as
%  those in FOM.

[r,c] = size(fom);  %  Dimensions of corner points

t = 0;  %  Starting point for t
%  Determine number of mics on array
