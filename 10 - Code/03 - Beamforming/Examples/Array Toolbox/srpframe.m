function [mleim, mleimn] = srpframe(sigar, gridax, mpos, fs, c, srchwin, powrez)
% This function processes signals from a microphone array relative to
% measurments in space containing the microphones and the sound sources.
% The mic positions field of view grid point with any uint as long as
% the units for parameters listed below are consistent (I like meters
% and seconds).  This version considers mic pair correlations and combines
% them separates (as opposed to simply computing the coherent power at the
% point in the spatial grid with all pairs).
% The output is the liklihood of the sound source as function of the
% spatial grid.  The number of axes in cell array GRIDAX determines the
% dimesion of the ouput liklihood grid.
%
%   [mleim] = mlescanprs(sigar, gridax, mpos, prs, fs, c, srchwin, powrez)
%
% Inputs
%  "sigar"        Matrix where each column is the rf signal segment from each mic.
%
%  "gridax"       Cell array of grid points for x-axis, y-axis and z-axis.
%                 The number of elements in this cell array can be less than
%                 3.  If so it will do a reduce dimension output space.
%
%  "mpos"         Matrix indicating the x,y, and z cartesion positions of each
%                 mic, where the first row contains the x positions, second y
%                 position, and third z positions.  If an axis is missing
%                 it will be assume to be the z and an array in the x-y
%                 plane will be assumed.  The Dimensions should be
%                 consisent with the axes in cell array "gridax" and number
%                 of mics must be the same as columns in "sigar."
%
%  "prs"          Matrix identifying all mic pairs for processing in each
%                 row.  Columns 1 and 2 contain the indices (corresponding
%                 to column indices of "mpos") for the particular mics in the
%                 pair.  An additional column can be present for a weighting
%                 of the pairs.  If not present, they all have the same
%                 weights
%           
%  "fs"           Sampling frequency of the rf mic signals in "sigar"
%
%  "c"            scalar is the speed of sound in the room.
%  "srchwin"       Search window length for a coherent sound.  This is 
%                 time in milliseconds from the most recent sample on the
%                 furthest mic from the point of interest. It is aligned
%                 such that the last point in the window corresponds to
%                 the last point (most recent time sample) of the non-delayed
%                 version of "sigar." Typically "srchwin" would be smaller than
%                 the length of "sigar" so the delays will result in
%                 measured data samples shifting into the listening window.
%                 If "sigar" is not long enough to have have samples to
%                 shift into the correlation window, zero padding will occur.
%
%  "powrez"       window over which power is computed.  Can be smaller than
%                 "srchwin"; however it cannot be larger
