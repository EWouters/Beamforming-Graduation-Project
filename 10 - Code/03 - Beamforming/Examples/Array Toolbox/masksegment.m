function  scriptm = masksegment(fnbase,pn,scriptf,streams,numofstrm)
% 
%  This function opens a sequence of files containing beamformed signals with
%  base name FNBASE and integer numberings 01, 02, 03, .... at the end of
%  each base name all located in a directory identified by string PN.
%  The test file SCRIPTF contains the starting and stopping locations
%  of each beamformed signal file along with the time it became active in
%  in the from the start of the recording.  The output is another set of
%  files on which auditory masking has been applied.
%
%       scriptm = masksegment(fnbase,pn,scriptf,numofstrm)
%   
%  Inputs:
%   FNBASE      =>  String identifying basename of files containing beamformed
%                    signals from each detected source
%   PN          =>  String with path name to directory containing beamformed file
%                    and also the directory to where the masked signals will also
%                    be written.
%   SCRIPTF     =>  Cell array containing the following information for each
%                    source:
%                    [segment#, xs,ys,zs, xe, ye, ze, time start, filename]
%   STREAMS     =>  The streams chosen by the user to be masked
%   NUMOFSTRM   =>  Number of valid streams detected during beamforming
%                    segment
%
% Output:
%   SCRIPTM     =>  Cell array the same as SCRIPTF
%                    File will be written to directory PN with the same 
%                    basename FNBASE and sequence number followed by 
%                    an 'm' to denote a masked sequence.
