function [ssi_val,tax] = intel(sig,nos,fs,twin)
% This function is used to estimate the intelligibility of the given
% speech-in-noise condition, where SIG is the signal of interest
% and NOS is the correpsonding noise or interfering signal.  Note 
% that signal and noise samples must be separable for this function
% to provide accurate estimates. Speech Intelligibility can be defined
% as the degree to which the speech can be understood correctly by
% the listener.
% The function calls the function 'sii.m' to calculate the speech
% intelligibility index based on the standard ANSI S3.5 1997 "Methods
% for calculation of the Speech Intelligibility Index" (Refer
% http://www.sii.to/html/programs.html).  Since intelligibility can change
% over hte course of a speech sample, this function breaks this extended
% signal into smaller segement and estimates the intelligibility index
% sequentially over the lenth of the signal:
%
%            [ssi_val,tax] = intel (sig,nos,fs,twin)
%
% The output is a vector of speech intelligibility indices which range
% between zero(completely unintelligible)and one(perfect intelligibility).
% The second output argument is the corresponding time axis in seconds
% where 0 denotes the starting point of the input signal. This function
% also calls 'spectrumlevel.m,' which estimates the spectrum levels at
% different bands of the signal segments.
%
% The input arguments are:
%   SIG => Vectorized Signal segment whose intelligibility has to be estimated in the given speech-in-noise condition.
%   NOS => Noise Signal segment(vector), SIG and NOS must have the same length.
%   fs => sampling frequency in Hertz
%   TWIN => Time interval in seconds which is used to segment the sig and nos
%           into 'twin' overlapping blocks(OPTIONAL)
