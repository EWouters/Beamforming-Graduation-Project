function [dettruepks, locerr, tarmag, nospks, nosmag, tnstats] = peaksort(im,ax,ay,targetloc, pltflag)
%  This function inputs a reconstructed acoustic image IM, along with the corresponding axes
%  points AX and AY for the columns and rows, respectively, the known postions of the
%  target locations, TARGETLOC, and an option figure plot flag PLTFLAG
%
%     [dettruepks, locerr, tarmag, nospks, nosmag, tnstats]  = peaksort(im,ax,ay,targetloc,pltflag)
%  
%  The input PLTFLAG can be any integer value. If it is present a figure of the raw acoustic
%  image will be generated with superimposed target locations (red x's), detected target
%  locations (green o's), and other peaks not associated with the target location (yellow circles)
%  representing false alarms peaks for a threhsold set at 0.
%  Outputs:
%  DETTRUEPKS - matrix of the detected locations of the target
%  LOCERR     - the distance between the actual target and detected target
%  TARMAG     - magnitude at detected location
%  NOSPKS     - matrix of detected locations of noise peaks representing
%               false alarms
%  NOSMAG     - matrix of noise peaks magnitudes
%  TNSTATS    - vector of [target peaks mean, noise mean, std target peaks, std noise]

% Sorting out a target peak from a false alarm peak is somewhat subjective.  The rules that this
% program uses is that a peak is considered a target if it is the nearest peak to the actual target
% location and any of the following hold:
%  1. It is in an adjacent pixel location to the true target, 
%  2. For a line between the target position the detected peak, the ratio between the smallest peak
%     height along the line and the height of the considered peak is
%     greater than 6 dB (assuming IM are coherent power values, not
%     amplitudes), and the smallest peak height along the line is positive.
% 
% False alarm peaks are determined as those peaks not associated directly with the target location.
% This excludes peaks that fall within the resolution area of the detected target.  The rules are
% peak is considered a false alarm peak if any of the following hold
%   1.  For a line between the closest detected target position (determined through the rules previously
%       stated) and the detected peak, the ratio between the smallest peak height along the line and the
%       maximum height of either the peak at the target position or the considered peak is
%       greater than 6 dB, or the smallest peak height along the line is negative.
