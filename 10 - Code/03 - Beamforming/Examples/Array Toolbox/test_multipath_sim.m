%  This script reads in an audio file segment of a phrase about a scare crow
%  and uses the simarraysig function to simulate this word spoken over an
%  array.  It compares the recording with and without multipath scatterers
%  and also for the near and far mic.  This script requires the programs
%  "simarraysig.m," "regmicsline.m," "roomimpres.m," and wave file scare_crow.wav
