% This script reads through a script to detect when a source emits a sound.
% Audio from FILENAME is read in segments, the size of which can be changed in the script
% through NWLEN. The 'forgetting factor' FF is a way to tweak the influence
% of previous detections/non-detections on the processing of the current
% sample. NOTE: this script will occasionaly throw out true sound source
% segments and still allow some non-detection segments to pass through. DET
% is a matrix which contains the timestamps of all the segments that the
% script marked as detections. DETREJECT contains all the other timestamps,
% and is useful for determining the effectiveness of the script for getting
% rid of non-detection audio segments.
