function [sd, tn] = delayf(s,fs,d,ns)
%  This function delays the signal in vector S sampled at FS by an amount
%  D denoted in seconds.  If NS is present in the input arguments, the output
%  signal length will be equal to this value in seconds (either by
%  truncating or zero padding).  If not present, the output signal length
%  will vary depending on the delay (it will be the original
%  signal length plus the max delay rounded up to the next sample).
%
%    [sd, tn] = delay(s,fs,d,ns)
%
%  The delayed version of the signal SD starts at the same time point (D should
%  not be negative otherwise an error will occur).  This version performs the delay
%  in the frequency domain.  IF TN is present in the output argument, a time axis is
%  created for the output array where 0 denotes the original starting point for S.
%  If S is a matrix, the program will assume each column is a signal and
%  the number of elements in D must be equal to the number of columns.
