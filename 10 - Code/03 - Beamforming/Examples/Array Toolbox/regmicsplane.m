function mpos = regmicsplane(fom,sp,geom)
%  This function generates the microphone coordinates for a regular
%  plane array placement over a plane or cube.
%
%      mpos = regmicsplane(fom, sp, geom)
% 
%  The inputs are:
%  FOM => the field over which the mics are placed. FOM is a 3 by 3
%         matrix where the first and last column define the opposite corners
%         of a rectangular space within which the mics are distributed. The
%         2nd column is an additional point that defines the plane.
%  SP =>  the spacing between mics in meters.  If a scalar, then spacing
%         is the same in all dimensions, otherwise if a 3 element vector
%         it defines the spacing in the x,y, and z directions (x,y,z).
%  GEOM => (optional input) flag indicating that the geometry of the spacing
%           is either rectangular or hexagonal.The options are:
%                GEOM = 'Rect' (default) is a rectilinear arrangment
%                GEOM = 'Hex' is a hexagonal spacing (in this case SP must be a scalar).


%  The first mic is placed at the first point (first column) in FOM. The
%  subsequent mics are placed with a constant spacing along the plane defined
%  by the FOM.  The last mic will be placed at the furthest point from the
%  beginning but still within or on the boundaries defined by FOM. 
%  The output will be columnwise coordinates of the microphones in matrix
%  MPOS.  The dimensionality of the output coordinates in MPOS will be the
%  same as those in FOM.
