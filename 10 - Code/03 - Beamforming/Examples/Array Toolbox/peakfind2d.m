function [posx, posy, mag] = peakfind2d(sig, tx, ty)
% This function finds local maxima in the 2-D matrix SIG.
% TX and TY are the spatial axes for SIG. The columns are indexed by TX and
% rows are indexed by TY.  If TX and TY are not present they will be assigned
% integer spacings starting with 0.
%
%    [pos, mag] = peakfind(sig, tx, ty)
%
% The output values are in vecotors POSX, and POSY correspond to the peak positions
% relative to the input vectors TX and TY, and MAG is the value at the corresponding
% local maximum.  Points on the edge of the matrix are not included in the
% peak search.
