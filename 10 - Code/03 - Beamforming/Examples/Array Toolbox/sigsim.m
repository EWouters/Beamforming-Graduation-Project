function [sigout, tax, td] = sigsim(f1,f2,winlen,fs,pcttap, sigpos, mpos, flims, c)
% This function will create an array of impulse-like signals associated
% with a sound eminating from spatial locations and received at an array of
% microphones.  Each microphone corresponds to a column in the output
% matrix "sigout."  ALso in the output is the corresponding time axis
% "tax" and time delays "td"
% 
%  [sigout, tax, td] = sigsim(f1,f2,winlen,fs,pcttap, sigpos, mpos, flims, c)
%
% The input arguments are sound source descriptors:
% f1 => Starting frequent of sound source
% f2 => Ending Frequency of sound source
% winlen => length of time window (should be at least 1/(f2-f1))
% pcttap => percentage of signal bandwitdth that tapers between 0 and 1 at
%           frequency edges
% fs =>  Signal sampling frequency
% sigpos => a matrix where each column represents the coordinates of a
%           signal source and each row is the dimension x,y, & z(if
%           present)
% mpos => a matrix where each column represents the coordinates of the mic
%         and each row is the dimension x,y, & z (if present)
% flims => a 2 column matrix with opposite corners over the field consider
%          for the presence of the sound source (note that the coordinates
%          of flims, mpos, and sigpos must be in the same frame of
%          reference).
%    c  => Speed of sound (FYI, c = 331.4+0.6*Temperature in Centigrade)
