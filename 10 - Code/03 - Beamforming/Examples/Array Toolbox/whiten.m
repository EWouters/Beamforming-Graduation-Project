function w = whiten(s,pw,flim)
% This function performs a partial whitening of signal contained in vector
% S.  The parameter PW ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 represents no spectral
% whitening and 1 represent complete spectral whitening:
%
%   w = whiten(s,pw,flim)
% 
% The whitening is performed in the frequency domain with parameter PW
% according to:
%
%                        S(f)
%        W(f) = ---------------------------------
%                      (abs(S(f))).^PW
%
%  where the division is only performed for non zero values of S(f), otherwise 
%  W(f) is set to 0.  If optional vector FLIM = [fl, fh] is given, then
%  only the frequencies between FL and FH are whitened.  The rest of the
%  frequencies are set to zero.
%
%  The output W will be the same size as S and is the time domain whitened
%  signal.  If S is a matrix, this program will perform a columnwise
%  whitening of the signal.
