function pa = mposanaly(mc,n)
%  This function performs an analysis on microphone subset geometry
%  for mics taken N at a time out of the entire array
%
%      pa = mposanaly(mc,n)
%
%  Coordinates for all microphones are in matrix MC where each
%  column denotes a mic position and each row represents the dimensions of
%  the coordinates.  The first N columns of the output matrix PA are the
%  indices identifying the mics in the subset, and the indices correspond
%  to columns of MC. The next column is the maximum distance between
%  microphones in the subset, then the minimum distance, and finally the standard
%  deviation between all mics, where the spacing to the closest mic is used.
