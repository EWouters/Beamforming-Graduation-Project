% This script converts the detection file to an auditory scene analysis
% (ASA) file and then creates a movie file (AVI) to display each of the 
% streams (location and time). 
%
% Required Programs:
%   convtpos.m      - Converts my detection file with time stamps to one
%                     compatible with Hari's program to create the ASA file
%   imsegm.m        - Hari's program to identify auditory streams from clustered
%                     detections - in time and space proximity
%   bfsegment.m     - Performs beamforming on detected streams and produces
%                     wave files for each beamformed stream
%   masksegment.m   - Performs auditory masking on detected streams, after
%                     beamforming
%   mkmov3d.m       - Converts ASA file to a stem plot movie of detected sources  
%   ListenMult.m    - Provides user interface allowing users to listen to
%                     found sources
